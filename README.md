# Drat R Archive Template for psolymos

This Drat repo was motivated by some users of my packages who could not use `devtools::install_github` because of government/company IT policy and firewall settings.

To add this Drat repository to you R installation, use the drat package:

```R
drat::addRepo("psolymos")
```
